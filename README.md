CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Our full stack project leverages Express HTML and JavaScript for server-side rendering, providing dynamic content. Additionally, we implemented a single-page application (SPA) using Angular for a more interactive user experience. Express HTML excels in server-side rendering, while SPAs excel in client-side interactivity, offering seamless content updates without full page reloads.&nbsp;

The backend uses a NoSQL MongoDB database for its flexibility with unstructured data and scalability. MongoDB's document-oriented structure aligns well with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), simplifying data storage and retrieval in our JavaScript-heavy stack.&nbsp;

Functionality&nbsp;

JSON serves as a lightweight data interchange format, facilitating communication between the frontend and backend. We extensively used JSON to pass data between the client and server, ensuring seamless communication and interoperability.&nbsp;

We refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, creating reusable UI components like Angular directives or React components. This approach streamlined development, reduced redundancy, and improved maintainability by modularizing the codebase.&nbsp;

Testing&nbsp;

Testing API endpoints is critical for reliability and security. We tested various methods for request and retrieval, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests, to validate functionality, handle edge cases, and ensure proper error handling. Testing with added security layers, such as authentication and authorization, was essential for protecting sensitive data.&nbsp;

Reflection&nbsp;

This course has been instrumental in my professional growth, providing a comprehensive understanding of full stack web development. I have mastered frontend and backend development, database management, API design, testing methodologies, and project management. These skills have made me a more competent developer and a more marketable candidate in my career field. I am now well-equipped to tackle complex projects and contribute effectively to innovative web applications.&nbsp;
