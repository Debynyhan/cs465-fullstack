Architecture

In my full stack project, I utilized Express HTML and JavaScript for server-side rendering, delivering dynamic content. Additionally, I implemented a single-page application (SPA) using Angular for a more interactive user experience. Express HTML is great for server-side rendering, while SPAs excel in client-side interactivity, offering seamless content updates without full page reloads.

The backend of my project uses a NoSQL MongoDB database for its flexibility with unstructured data and scalability. MongoDB's document-oriented structure aligns well with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), simplifying data storage and retrieval in my JavaScript-heavy stack.

Functionality

JSON serves as a lightweight data interchange format, facilitating communication between my frontend and backend. I extensively used JSON to pass data between the client and server, ensuring seamless communication and interoperability.

I refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, creating reusable UI components like Angular directives or React components. This approach streamlined development, reduced redundancy, and improved maintainability by modularizing the codebase.

Testing

Testing API endpoints is critical for reliability and security. I tested various methods for request and retrieval, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end (E2E) tests, to validate functionality, handle edge cases, and ensure proper error handling. Testing with added security layers, such as authentication and authorization, was essential for protecting sensitive data.

Reflection

This course has been instrumental in my professional growth, providing a comprehensive understanding of full stack web development. I have mastered frontend and backend development, database management, API design, testing methodologies, and project management. These skills have made me a more competent developer and a more marketable candidate in my career field. I am now well-equipped to tackle complex projects and contribute effectively to innovative web applications
